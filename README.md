# Gantastic

## UROP Project with TLDR Group (Dyson School of Engineering, Imperial College London)
The project was done from 06/2021 to 09/2021 and the research was focused around Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

### Exploring MNIST
Created a basic GAN network and trained using the MNIST dataset
- Network architecture in `conditional_gan_mnist/code_files/networks.py`
- Network hyper-parameters in `conditional_gan_mnist/code_files/params.py`
- Data preprocessing functions in `conditional_gan_mnist/code_files/preprocessing.py`
- Training function in `conditional_gan_mnist/code_files/training.py`
- Function that runs the model `conditional_gan_mnist/code_files/run_model.py`
- Utility functions used in the model `conditional_gan_mnist/code_files/util.py`
